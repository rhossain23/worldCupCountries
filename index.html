    <br>Every soccer player that played at the World Cup has a "National" team and a "Club" team*. National teams represent a country, while 
        Club teams usually represent a city or region within a country. 
        This visualization shows all of the countries that were represented at the World Cup through club teams.</br>
    <br>*Throughout the years, some players did not have a club team while playing at the World Cup.
        They were included in the overall number of players at the World Cup, 
        but not in the totals for the country they represented.</br>
